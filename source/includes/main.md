# Introduction

Shiptheory provodes a REST API that allows you to communicate directly with all of our [supported carriers](https://shiptheory.com/#integrations). Currently the following methods are available.

* Book Shipment

Book a shipment over the API using Shiptheory's automatic shipping rules or specify a specific carrier directly.

* Get Shipping Labels

Get any shipping labels attached to an existing shipment.

* Get Tracking Number

Get the tracking number of an existing shipment.

* Get Services

List all Carriers, delivery services, formats and enhancements available on your Shiptheory account.

## Testing with Postman

Postman is a great app that allows you to send make HTTP requests and is useful when developing API integrations.

We have published a collection of Shiptheory API test calls on Postman that may save you some time during development.

# Authentication

> To obtain an authentication token:

```php
$data = json_encode(
    array(
        "email" => "you@youremail.com",
        "password" => "password"
    )
);

$ch = curl_init('https://shiptheory.com/api/token');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Accept: application/json',
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data))
);

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $result;
```

```javascript
// make sure you have installed the reques module (npm install request)
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  url: 'https://shiptheory.com/api/token',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  form: {
      email: 'you@youremail.com',
      password: 'password'
  }
};

request.post(options, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('Request Failed:', err);
  }
  console.log(body);
});
```
> The above code returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{  
   "success":true,
   "data":{  
      "token":"asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..."
   }
}
```

All requests to Shiptheory must contain an authentication bearer token. Use your regular [Shiptheory account](https://shiptheory.com/login) username and password to request a token.

The authentication bearer token must be included in the header of all subsequent requests as per below.

`Authorization: Bearer asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..`

<aside class="notice">
Authentication tokens <code>expire after 10 minutes</code>.

      "Parcel - Next Day": {

      }
     }
   }
}
```

When booking a shipment, if you pass a ``delivery_service`` your shipment will skip shipping rules and book the shipment with the carrier that owns the specified delivery service.

The ``delivery_service`` field relates directly to the ``id`` of the Delivery Service in Shiptheory. You can get a list of the Delivery Services available to your Shiptheory account by calling the Services API endpoint.
